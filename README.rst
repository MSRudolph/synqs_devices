README for synqs_devices
========================

`Labscript <https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/labscriptsuite>`_ devices as used at `SynQS <https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/synqs/>`_.

Devices include:

* Mako G 030-B camera. It uses  `Pymba <https://github.com/morefigs/pymba>`_ as a backbone. Although this labscript code is written and tested just for Mako G030-B camera, it should work for many other camera models too (with little to zero modification), because Pymba works for them.
* SynthHDDevice. It programs the `SynthHD <https://windfreaktech.com/product/microwave-signal-generator-synthhd/>`_.
* YunTemp. Integrating our `temperature control <https://github.com/synqs/DeviceControlServer>`_ directly in BLACS. *Not running for the moment.*
* CustomArduinoDevice. Control of the Arno tower as described in the PhD of Arno Trautmann.

Installation
------------

We follow the guidelines of the `PR <https://bitbucket.org/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pull-requests/81/user-devices/diff>`_ and this `google discussion <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/labscriptsuite/lfjUu29zku8>`_. So you `clone` this folder into the folder  `<labscript_install_folder>/userlib/user_devices`

.. code-block:: python

  git clone https://github.com/fretchen/synqs_devices/ <labscript_install_folder>/userlib/user_devices


What are the files for ?
------------------------

- blacs_workers are the hardware bindings.
- blacs_tabs is the gui.
- labscript_devices and register_classes are for integration with labscriptsuite. They are very boilerplate
