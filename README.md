# SynQS_devices
 [Labscript](https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/labscriptsuite) devices as used at [SynQS](https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/synqs/).

 Devices include:

* Mako G 030-B camera. It uses [Pymba](https://github.com/morefigs/pymba) as a backbone. Although this labscript code is written and tested just for Mako G030-B camera, it should work for many other camera models too (with little to zero modification), because Pymba works for them.
